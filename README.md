# adams-blue-book-in-latex
Project to typeset Adams's blue book in LaTeX

Notes on a few macros:
\nn, short for new notation, was added to compile the pdf with old or new notation
\nnt, short for new notation tensor (product), was added to compile with either \wedge or \otimes for the wedge product of spectra
\maybeprintindex was added to print a custom index I'm compiling while retyping the book.
